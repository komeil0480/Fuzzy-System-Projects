Project 1: Fuzzy Cell Density Optimization

Designed and implemented a precise fuzzy logic control system using the skfuzzy library in Python. The goal was to optimize cell density in a biological context, crucial for applications like cancer research. The project included a comprehensive report detailing system development and output calculations for varying scenarios.

Project 2: Intelligent Mountain Car Control

Developed an advanced control system using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering and skfuzzy in Python to navigate a simulated mountain car with limited engine power. A detailed report covered variable definitions, rule formulation, and real-time action calculations.

Project 3: Credit Card Customer Segmentation

Applied Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering and skfuzzy in Python to segment credit card customers for targeted marketing. Processed a dataset, created "TOTAL_BILL" feature, and conducted data normalization. The project determined optimal clusters, visualized data, and analyzed relationships with payment defaults.
